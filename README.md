Title: Website-Specific Chatbot with Streamlit and LangChain

Overview

This project implements a flexible chatbot that can hold conversations informed by content from a specified website. It leverages the power of Streamlit for a web-based interface and LangChain for advanced language modeling and information retrieval.

Features

Contextualized Conversations: The chatbot understands the context of previous interactions, allowing for more natural and informative conversations.
Website-Driven Knowledge: The chatbot draws its knowledge base directly from a website you specify, ensuring responses are relevant to the website's content.
OpenAI Integration: Leverages OpenAI's language models for fluent and informative responses.
Web-Based Interface: Streamlit provides a user-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
Dependencies

Python 3.x
Streamlit
LangChain
langchain-openai
langchain-community
dotenv
Installation

Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
Use code with caution.
Create a virtual environment (recommended):
Bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
Use code with caution.
Install required packages:
Bash
pip install streamlit langchain langchain-openai langchain-community dotenv
Use code with caution.
Setup

Obtain OpenAI API Key:

Create an OpenAI account if you don't have one.
Find your API key on your account settings page.
Create .env file:

Create a file named .env in the project's root directory.
Add the following line, replacing with your actual API key:
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
Usage

Start the Streamlit app:

Bash
streamlit run app.py  # Replace 'app.py' with your main script file
Use code with caution.
Open in a web browser:

The app will typically open automatically in your default browser. Otherwise, go to http://localhost:8501.
Provide Settings:

Enter the website URL you want the chatbot to use.
Enter your valid OpenAI API key.
Start chatting! Interact with the chatbot and see how it leverages the website's information for its responses.

How it Works

Vector Store Creation: The code loads the specified website and splits its content into chunks. These chunks are then embedded and stored in a Chroma vector store.
Retrieval and Response Generation:
The user's queries are used to generate a new search query targeted at the vector store.
Relevant content is retrieved from the vector store, providing context for the response.
The OpenAI LLM combines retrieved context and the original query to generate an informed response.

Customization

Experiment with different websites to tailor the chatbot's knowledge base.
Explore the various modules and prompt templates within LangChain to fine-tune the chatbot's behavior.
Note: To use Google Gemini, you'd need to make adjustments to the code and obtain credentials for its API.
